README for rmdupe


OVERVIEW
========

rmdupe uses standard linux commands to search within specified folders for 
duplicate files, regardless of filename or extension. Before duplicate 
candidates are removed they are compared byte-for-byte. rmdupe can also 
check duplicates against one or more reference folders, can trash files 
instead of removing them, allows for a custom removal command, and can 
limit its search to files of specified size. rmdupe includes a simulation 
mode which reports what will be done for a given command without actually 
removing any files.
